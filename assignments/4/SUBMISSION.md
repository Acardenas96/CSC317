## Brief Description of implementation


One of the biggest challenges I faced while implementing my JavaScript calculator was handling keyboard input. At first, I thought it would be complicated, and even after following a YouTube tutorial, my approach didn’t work. Eventually, I realized the solution was much simpler than I imagined. By using the keydown event and integrating it with my existing logic, the functionality came together smoothly. Another challenge was getting my live page to function properly, which turned out to be an issue of forgetting to include necessary files. Implementing the +/− toggle was also tricky, but after some trial and error, I managed to get it working correctly. Beyond the core requirements, I added a theme switcher feature that allows users to click buttons and dynamically change the calculator’s style, making it more interactive and visually appealing. Throughout the process, I relied on resources like W3Schools, GeeksforGeeks, Stack Overflow, and the tutorial video “Build This Calculator in 15 Minutes!” by Bro Code, which helped guide my approach.
