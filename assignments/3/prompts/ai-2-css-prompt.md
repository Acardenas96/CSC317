Hello chatgpt, so I need to make a stylesheet for my assignment which is a basic html portfolio page which has these elements: html, head, title, link, body, nav, ul, li, a, section, header, h1, img, p, h2, h3, strong,and footer. I would like it to be responsive, so that it works on small and big screens. on typography, i think sans serif should be good. On the color scheme i really like navy blue, white and maybe some light gray for a gradient or soft effect. I want the image to be an avatar and my nav to be a navigation bar
