        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a BS degree in Computer Science at San Francisco State University. 
            This semester, I am enrolled in CSC 317 (Web Software Development), CSC 340 (Data Structures and Algorithms), 
            CSC 300GWAR (Ethics and Law in Computing), and MATH 314 (Statistics and Probability), which are helping me build 
            a strong foundation in both programming and analytical thinking.</p>

<p>My career interests include game development and cybersecurity. I find that video game analogies 
    help me understand coding concepts more intuitively, which has sparked my interest in designing 
    interactive systems. I am also drawn to the challenges of cybersecurity, particularly the idea of 
    investigating online scams and protecting users from digital threats.

<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Word Ladder Game in C++</li>
    <p>-This C++ application implements a word transformation algorithm that identifies the 
        shortest sequence of valid dictionary words connecting a user-defined start and target word. 
        Utilizing breadth-first search (BFS), the program efficiently navigates a curated word set to 
        construct a minimal path, ensuring each intermediate word differs by only one character. 
        The solution emphasizes clean input handling, modular design, and optimized traversal logic 
        suitable for academic and enterprise-level applications.</p>
    <li>Snake Game in C++</li>
    <p>-This C++ project is a console-based implementation of the classic Snake game, designed to 
        demonstrate real-time input handling, dynamic rendering, and collision detection. 
        The game utilizes procedural logic to manage player movement, fruit generation, and tail growth, 
        while maintaining responsive gameplay through keyboard polling and timed screen refreshes. 
        It showcases effective use of control structures, memory-safe array management, and modular design 
        principles suitable for foundational game development and systems programming.</p>
