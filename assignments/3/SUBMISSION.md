# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
For my part, I focused on building out the cyberpunk CSS for our portfolio. I wanted it to feel bold and techy but still readable—kind of like Vice City meets glitchy student showcase. I used neon colors, glitchy borders, and brush-style headers to give it personality, while keeping the layout clean and modular. I also handled the Git stuff for our branch (ai-1-css), making sure everything was organized and pushed properly. One thing I learned was how much small design choices affect the vibe—like hover effects and font pairings. I also wrote the AI prompt that generated the CSS, so it’s documented and repeatable. Overall, I tried to mix creativity with structure and make something that actually feels like me while still hitting the assignment goals.


## Individual Reflections

### [Abraham Cardenas] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
While working on the hand-written CSS portion of our project, I discovered that the line height: var(--heading-height); inside the header {} block was creating excessive white space between my profile image and the text below it. Removing that line immediately resolved the spacing issue and made the layout feel more balanced. This taught me how even a single CSS variable can dramatically affect visual flow, especially when working with custom properties. It also reminded me to inspect inherited styles and test layout changes iteratively. Aside from that fix, I primarily focused on refining the header structure and ensuring the visual hierarchy felt intuitive.

### [Jerome Fernando] - AI Text Prompt CSS
When creating one of the AI generated CSS stylesheets, my main goal was to experiment with design and gain an understanding of how styling choices can really have an impact on the personality of a webpage. Design choice direction was also one of my biggest struggles for this assignment. Ultimately I settled for prompting AI to create a cleaner looking stylesheet - with the sections separated into their own flexboxes for added design flexibility, a simple font for easy readability, and a softer color scheme that is visually pleasing. One of the other biggest lessons I learned was how to navigate the direction I wanted the AI to go through prompting. Being ultra specific on key details really helped me ensure that the AI is doing exactly what I want it to do and that it did not stray too far and generate the code in a way that I can still understand and maybe pick up some things to use in the future.
