# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
For my part, I focused on building out the cyberpunk CSS for our portfolio. I wanted it to feel bold and techy but still readable—kind of like Vice City meets glitchy student showcase. I used neon colors, glitchy borders, and brush-style headers to give it personality, while keeping the layout clean and modular. I also handled the Git stuff for our branch (ai-1-css), making sure everything was organized and pushed properly. One thing I learned was how much small design choices affect the vibe—like hover effects and font pairings. I also wrote the AI prompt that generated the CSS, so it’s documented and repeatable. Overall, I tried to mix creativity with structure and make something that actually feels like me while still hitting the assignment goals.
